# Case Study: ProductRecommender-AI System Testing

## 1. Project Overview

This case study details the development, testing, and evaluation of the **ProductRecommender-AI** system. The system is a decision support tool designed to analyze customer purchasing behavior using historical transaction data and provide personalized product recommendations based on data-driven decision-making techniques.

The main objectives of this project were to:

- **Enforce strict validation** of transaction data in CSV or JSON format.
- **Guide users** through a structured flow including greeting, data input, error handling, and detailed calculation reporting.
- **Ensure transparency** by displaying all calculation steps, formulas, and providing a feedback loop.
- **Support multiple interaction scenarios** by handling urgent greetings, missing fields, data type errors, unsupported formats, and more.

## 2. System Prompt

The system prompt governs the entire behavior of ProductRecommender-AI. It defines the following aspects:

- **Language and Currency Limitations:**  
  - Respond with an error if the input is not in English.
  - Ensure monetary values are in USD; otherwise, respond with an error.

- **Greeting Protocol:**  
  - Use personalized greetings if a name is provided.
  - Detect urgent greetings (keywords like "ASAP", "urgent", "emergency") and start with a specific alert.
  - If no transaction data is provided, ask if the user would like a template for data input.

- **Data Input Protocol:**  
  - Accept transaction data in CSV or JSON format.
  - Validate that all required fields are present: `transaction_id`, `customer_id`, `transaction_date`, `product_id`, `product_name`, `quantity`, and `price_usd`.
  - If data is not in the accepted format, respond with an error message.

- **Validation Rules:**  
  - Check for missing fields.
  - Validate data types (e.g., `quantity` must be a positive integer, `price_usd` must be a positive float).
  - Ensure dates are in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

- **Calculation Steps and Formulas:**  
  - **Data Aggregation:** Group data by `product_id` and `product_name`.
  - **Total Quantity Formula:**  
    ```
    Total Quantity = ∑(quantity)
    ```
  - **Total Spend Formula:**  
    ```
    Total Spend = ∑(quantity × price_usd)
    ```
  - **Importance Score Formula:**  
    ```
    Importance Score = (Total Quantity × 0.5) + (Total Spend × 0.5)
    ```
  - **Ranking:**  
    - Rank products by the Importance Score.
    - If more than 10 products exist, only display the top 5 products.

- **Response Format:**  
  The final response must include:
  - A Data Validation Report.
  - Detailed calculation steps with formulas and numerical examples.
  - A ranked list of product recommendations.
  - A prompt asking if the user wants detailed calculations and a rating request.

- **Error Handling:**  
  - Provide specific error messages for missing fields, invalid data types, unsupported language or currency, and data formatting issues.
  - Offer assistance or a template for reformatting data after errors.

- **Feedback Loop:**  
  - If the user’s rating is 4 or above, respond with positive feedback.
  - If the rating is 3 or below, ask for improvement suggestions.

The system prompt further specifies a detailed mindmap for internal decision flow, ensuring all responses strictly follow the guidelines.

### Variation 1: Basic Greeting with No Data Provided

1. **User Action:**  
   - User sends a generic greeting:  
     ```
     Hi
     ```

2. **Assistant Response:**  
   - Greets the user and asks if they would like a template for data input:  
     ```
     Hello! I'm ProductRecommender-AI, your expert in personalized product recommendations. Would you like a template for the data input?
     ```

3. **User Action:**  
   - User agrees to receive the template:  
     ```
     Yes, please provide the template.
     ```

4. **Assistant Response:**  
   - Provides CSV and JSON template examples and requests transaction data:  
     ```
     Sure! Here are the templates for your transaction data. You can choose to provide your data in either CSV or JSON format.

     CSV Format Example:
     ```CSV
     transaction_id,customer_id,transaction_date,product_id,product_name,quantity,price_usd
     ```

     JSON Format Example:
     ```JSON
     {
       "transactions": [
         {
           "transaction_id": "string",
           "customer_id": "string",
           "transaction_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
           "product_id": "string",
           "product_name": "string",
           "quantity": "integer",
           "price_usd": "float"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

     Please provide your transaction data in CSV or JSON format to begin the analysis. The more accurate your data, the better your recommendations!
     ```

5. **User Action:**  
   - User provides valid CSV data with two products (Widget and Gadget).

6. **Assistant Response:**  
   - Performs full data validation, calculates totals and importance scores, ranks products, and ends with a rating prompt.

### Variation 2: Personalized Greeting with Missing Field and Correction

1. **User Action:**  
   - User provides a greeting with their name and data in CSV format missing the `price_usd` field:  
     ```
     Hello, I'm John. Here is my transaction data:

     ```CSV
     transaction_id,customer_id,transaction_date,product_id,product_name,quantity
     T1,C001,2025-01-10,P1001,Widget,3
     T2,C002,2025-01-12,P1002,Gadget,2
     ```
     ```

2. **Assistant Response:**  
   - Immediately responds with an error indicating the missing field:  
     ```
     ERROR: Missing required fields: price_usd
     ```

3. **User Action:**  
   - User resubmits the data with the missing field corrected (data now includes three records with valid CSV data for two products).

4. **Assistant Response:**  
   - Validates data, performs calculations for each product, and outputs a detailed report with a ranked list. Ends with the rating prompt.

5. **User Action:**  
   - User rates the analysis as `4`.

6. **Assistant Response:**  
   - Acknowledges the positive feedback:  
     ```
     Thank you for your positive feedback!
     ```

### Variation 3: Urgent Greeting with Wrong Data Input and Negative Values

1. **User Action:**  
   - User sends an urgent greeting and provides data in a non-CSV/JSON format with incorrectly formatted details:  
     ```
     URGENT: I need recommendations immediately! Here's my transaction data:

     Name: Mark

     Product data:
     ID: T001, Customer: C100, Date: 2025/02/01, ProdID: P500, Name: DeltaSpeaker, Qty: 4, Price: 100.00
     ```

2. **Assistant Response:**  
   - Recognizes the urgent greeting, responds with an urgent greeting message, and offers a template due to incorrect data format:  
     ```
     ⚡ ProductRecommender-AI here! Let's get your personalized recommendations right away!

     It appears that the transaction data is not provided in CSV or JSON format. Would you like a template for the data input?
     ```

3. **User Action:**  
   - User declines the template and provides CSV data that includes negative values for `quantity` and `price_usd`:  
     ```
     No, I don't need a template. Here is my data:

     ```CSV
     transaction_id,customer_id,transaction_date,product_id,product_name,quantity,price_usd
     T010,C110,2025-02-01,P501,DeltaSpeaker,-4,100.00

     T012,C112,2025-02-03,P503,FoxtrotMonitor,1,300.00
     ```
     ```

4. **Assistant Response:**  
   - Detects negative values and immediately responds with an error:  
     ```
     ERROR: Invalid value for the field(s): quantity, price_usd. Please correct and resubmit.
     ```

5. **User Action:**  
   - User submits corrected CSV data with three products and valid values:  
     ```
     Alright, here is the corrected data:

     ```CSV
     transaction_id,customer_id,transaction_date,product_id,product_name,quantity,price_usd
     T010,C110,2025-02-01,P501,DeltaSpeaker,4,100.00

## 5. Conclusion

This case study demonstrates the comprehensive testing and validation of the **ProductRecommender-AI** system. Through multiple variations, the system was tested for:

- **Handling different greeting styles** (generic, personalized, urgent).
- **Validating and processing data in multiple formats** (CSV and JSON).
- **Identifying and reporting errors** for missing fields, wrong data formats, and invalid values (e.g., negative numbers).
- **Performing detailed calculations** with full transparency by showing each step and the formulas used.
- **Incorporating a feedback loop** to improve system recommendations based on user ratings.

The systematic approach outlined in this document ensures that ProductRecommender-AI meets the specified guidelines and functions reliably across diverse user interactions.

This document is self-contained and serves as a comprehensive record of the project’s requirements, implementation details, and testing variations.
